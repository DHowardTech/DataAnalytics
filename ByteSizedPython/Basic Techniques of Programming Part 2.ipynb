    "### Scenario: A Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review the problem of calculating the diameter and circumference of a circle\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is assumed that a software developer is asked to write a Python program that can calculate and print out the diameter and the circumference of a circle. The user enters data of the radius and its measurement unit (in, ft, cm, or m) from the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a Pseudo-Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Start\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Read the input of the radius from the console\n",
    " - if (radius<0),\n",
    "      - inform the user about the error\n",
    "\n",
    "      - request to read again\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Read the measurement unit of the radius (in, ft, cm, m)\n",
    " - if (unit is not among (in, ft, cm, m)),\n",
    "      - inform the user about the error\n",
    "      - request to read again\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the diameter of the circle\n",
    " - diameter = 2 * radius\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the circumference of the circle\n",
    " - Circumference + diameter * PI (3.14159)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Print out the diameter\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Print out the circumference\n",
    "\n",
    "8. End\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus on this piece of pseudo-code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the input of the radius from the console\n",
    " - if (radius < 0),\n",
    "      - inform the user about the error\n",
    "\n",
    "      - request to read again\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if the user makes mistakes while entering the radius data again and again?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The program must perform the checking again and again until it can read a valid piece of data._\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the program must repeatedly check the input until it gets the correct one â†’ the program uses <font color= blue>LOOPS.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "while (<loop-continuation condition.):\n",
    "\n",
    "    // ... ... ... statements(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "radius = ... # radius of the circle\n",
    "\n",
    "while (radius < 0):\n",
    "\n",
    "    print (\"Radius cannot be negative!!!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    print (\"Enter radius:\")\n",
    "\n",
    "radius = input(\"Enter radius: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red> **IMPORTANT NOTES:**</font>\n",

    " - In Python, WHILE loop also has an \"ELSE\" statement as IF does.\n",
    "\n",
    " - However, it is strongly discouraged from using the ELSE statement of WHILE because it causes confusion and can make the code too complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - For more details, see the example in the following section of FOR loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  for Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python for loop is an iterator based for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "It steps through the items of lists, tuples, strings, the keys of dictionaries, and other iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python for loop starts with the keyword for followed by an arbitrary variable name, which will hold the values of the following sequence object, which is stepped through.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "for (variable) in (sequence):\n",
    "\n",
